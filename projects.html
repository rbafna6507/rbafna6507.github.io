                <p class="project-desc">Implemented flight path optimization in Python using the A* path finding algorithm on the OpenFlights 
                    dataset, containing 67,663 unique routes, 3,321 airports, and 548 airlines. Built a real-time map-based visualizer 
                    and Next.js frontend to inspect flight route optimization based on distance traveled,
                    fuel consumption, time taken, and overall environmental impact. peep the code.</p>
