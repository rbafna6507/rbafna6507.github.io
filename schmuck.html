        <h5>Hi, I'm Rohan &#128075</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>I'm currently a second year at the University of Michigan studying computer engineering, with a bit of dedicated CS and EE sprinkled in.</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>When I'm not doing school related things, I'm either building things (hardware & software) or trying to give back to the community. Ideally, I'm doing both at the same time.</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>
            As part of <a href = "https://atlasdigital.org/"><u>Atlas Digital</u></a>, I work on several pro-bono technical projects for companies in and around the Ann Arbor area to improve their day-to-day operations using code - everything from automating ordering ingredients and managing reservations to creating apps for students to download. And as co-director of <a href="https://shiftcreator.space/"><u>Shift Creator Space</u></a>, I help mentor Creators, helping them explore differentn passions to make their imagination a reality - whether it’s a collage of artworks or a startup. Through community events, we nurture our Creators and forge genuine relationships between each member of the community.
        </h5>
            <br>
        <!-- <h5>Through my work as a research assistant at the University of South Carolina, I discovered my interest in machine learning and its endless applications in computer vision and natural language processing.</h5>
            <br> -->
        <h5>
            And when I’m trying to keep it low-key, you'll find me buried in yet another <a href = 'https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/722412.The_Dream_Machine'><u>book</u></a>, <a href = 'https://open.spotify.com/user/rbafna6507'><u>listening to music</u></a>, or *trying* to learn how to sketch.
