        <h5>Hi, I'm Rohan &#128075</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>I'm currently a senior at Riverside High School in Greenville, South Carolina.</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>When I'm not doing school related things, I'm either building things (hardware & software) or trying to give back to the community. Ideally, I'm doing both at the same time.</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>As part of National Honor Society & Students for Change, I help out on a bunch of community improvement projects like volunteering at <a href = "https://www.sustainingway.org/annies-house/" target = "_blank"><u>Annie's House</u></a>, an inexpensive and sustainable model for breaking out of poverty, or planting trees through <a href = "https://www.treesupstate.org/who-we-are/" target = "_blank"><u>TreesGreenville</u></a>.
            Pre-pandemic, I volunteered at my local <a href = "https://www.ropermountain.org/" target="_blank"><u>science center</u></a> where I help set-up science projects and promote interest in STEM through displaying cool technology to elementary and middle schoolers.</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>Through my work as a research assistant at the University of South Carolina, I discovered my interest in machine learning and its endless applications in computer vision and natural language processing.</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>With the Programming Club that I co-lead, I'm teach other students at Riverside the joy of programming & independent learning.
            We emphasize learning how to code through individual projects and coding challenges, with a little help along the way.</h5>
            <br>
        <h5>And last but not least, I also run <a href = "scolare.org" target = "_blank"><u>Scolare</u></a>, a non-profit that tutors students from k-12 in my area free of charge, utilizing high school volunteers as our tutors.</h5>
            <br>
            <h5>Feel free to check out some of my past <a href = "actualprojects.html"><u>work</u></a> & definitely <a href= "mailto:rbafna6507@gmail.com?subject=Hello!" target= "_blank"><u>reach out</u></a> if you want to talk more!</h5>
